        <p >
        Our agency was founded in the early 1900's by Sherlock Holmes.

        <p >
        Our founder went on to create quite the name for himself.<br/>
        His nephew carried on his legacy, building locations in Africa and Europe.<br/>
        His children went on to build the new head quarters in California.<br/>
        The American offices are now run by Detective Scooby Doo and his team.<br/>
        We are now at your service all over the world.<br/>
